title: Importere Last.fm-spilleliste inn i Spotify
date: 2013-11-23
---

En gammel oppskrift for å importere spillelister inn i Spotify:

-   Åpne Last.fm-spillelisten i Firefox, merk teksten og kopier den inn i Excel. Fjern overflødige kolonner.
-   Kopier listen inn i Emacs. Gjør en søk-og-erstatt-operasjon slik at linjene er på formatet `Artist[tab]Track`.
-   Lagre dette som en tekstfil og last den opp til nettjenesten [SpotMySongs](http://spotmysongs.com/).
-   Dra den resulterende sporlisten inn i en ny spilleliste i Spotify.

En brukers «Most Played Tracks» kan være et interessant utgangspunkt når Last.fm oppgir høy kompatibilitet.

>
> Ya that worked. Though don't try the auto import, it hangs. Have to select text from the converted spotify song codes and paste into a new spotify playlist inside the application.
