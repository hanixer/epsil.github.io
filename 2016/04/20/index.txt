The following setup allows you to [run Bash scripts from Windows' command prompt](#usage). It also augments the command prompt with common Unix commands like `ls`, `mv` and `rm`, which is useful if these are ingrained into your muscle memory.

(For a list of standalone Bash shells for Windows, see [alternatives](#alternatives).)

Usage
-----

The minimum requirement is to [install MSYS](#msys). You can then open a command prompt window and run a Bash script as follows:

    sh script.sh

If the script accepts parameters, just provide them at the end:

    sh script.sh --param1 val1 --param2 val2

Below follow installation instructions for [MSYS](#msys), [MinGW](#mingw) and [G*nu*W*in*32](#gnuwin32).

[MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys)
--------------------------------------

Install [MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys). Ensure that `sh.exe` is globally available by appending MSYS' `bin/` directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

You now run Bash scripts as [shown above](#usage), as well as use common Unix commands like `ls`, `mv` and `rm`.

[MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
------------------------------

For more Unix utilities, augment the above setup with a complete installation of [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Append its directory to `PATH` *after* MSYS.

You can now compile C programs (with `gcc`) and C++ programs (with `g++`).

[G*nu*W*in*32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/)
------------------------------------------------

For even more Unix utilities, install [G*nu*W*in*32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/). Append its directory to `PATH` *after* MSYS and MinGW.

For example, `wget` downloads a file from the command prompt.

Alias `open`
------------

Windows does not have the `open` command. To alias it to `start`, create a `C:\Windows\open.bat` file containing the following:

    @echo off
    start %*

Alternatives
------------

Windows 10 includes its own [Linux Bash Shell](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/), based on Ubuntu. Note that this is a *standalone* shell, and does not interfere with Windows' command prompt.

Another comprehensive standalone shell is provided by the [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) project, which can be used on older Windows versions. MSYS and MinGW also include standalone shells, and [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) provides a "Git Bash" shell.
