<!--
To do:

-   ~~Git Bash should be installed first.~~
    -   How does the override option affect `PATH`?
-   ~~MSYS may be superfluous.~~
    -   ~~If so, where to place `open.bat`?~~
-   Does Git Bash's MingGW differ from the default MinGW?
-   ~~On Windows 10, the `PATH` variable is not separated by `;`.~~
-   ~~Update PATHEXT~~
-   Update CSS so that header does not affect the width of the window.
    -   Requires refactoring the default stylesheet

The following setup allows us to [run Bash scripts from Windows' command prompt](#usage). It also augments the command prompt with common Unix commands like `cp`, `rm` and `mv`, which is useful if these are ingrained into muscle memory.

(For a list of standalone Bash shells for Windows, see [alternatives](#alternatives).)

[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/)
---------------------------------------

Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/). When asked whether to install additional Unix utilities, choose *yes*.

We can now open a command prompt window and run a Bash script as follows:

    sh script.sh

If the script accepts parameters, we just provide them at the end:

    sh script.sh --param1 val1 --param2 val2

Git for Windows also extends the command prompt with common Unix commands like `cp`, `rm` and `mv`:

    cp script.sh script2.sh
    rm script.sh
    mv script2.sh script.sh

"Git Bash", a [standalone shell](#alternatives), is installed as well.

### Update `PATHEXT`

With further refinements, we can trim the initial "`sh`" from the script invocation. First, associate `.sh` files with `sh.exe`. To do this, create a blank `script.sh` file (with Notepad, for example) and right-click on it. Choose *Open with* from the context menu. Click *More apps* and navigate to `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe`. Enable *Always use this app to open .sh files* and click *OK*.

Next, update the value of the `PATHEXT` environmental variable. To access the variable, go to *Control Panel* -> *System* -> *Advanced* -> *Environment Variables*. The value is a list of file extensions separated by `;`, for example:

    .COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC

Add `;.SH` to the end:

    .COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC;.SH

We can now run `.sh` files *directly* from the command prompt, like so:

    script.sh --param1 val1 --param2 val2

Note that the `.sh` extension is required to identify the file as a Bash script. Windows does *not* parse the `#!/bin/sh` shebang line; to execute an extensionless script, use `sh` (e.g., `sh script`).

### [MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys)

Git for Windows bundles MSYS for all Unix functionality. Alternatively, MSYS can also be installed *without* Git.

If MSYS is installed with [Git for Windows](#git-for-windows), as shown above, then skip this step. Otherwise, run the [MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys) installer and ensure that `sh.exe` is globally available by *appending* the location of MSYS' executables (its `bin/` directory) to the `PATH` environment variable. The value is a list of file paths separated by `;`, for example:

    %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Ruby22\bin

Thus, if MSYS' executables are located in `C:\msys\1.0\bin`, simply add `;C:\msys\1.0\bin` to the end:

    %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;C:\Ruby22\bin;C:\msys\1.0\bin

On Windows 10, the variable may be displayed as an editable list of directories. Add the directory to the bottom of the list.

### [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

For additional developer tools, augment the above setup with a complete installation of [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). Append its directory to `PATH` *after* the other directories.

We can now link (`ld`) and compile C programs (`gcc`) and C++ programs (`g++`).

[G*nu*W*in*32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/)
------------------------------------------------

For even more Unix utilities, install [G*nu*W*in*32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/). Append its directory to `PATH` *after* the other directories.

We now have a host of tools at our command. For example, `wget` downloads a file via the command prompt, while `md5sum` calculates its MD5 hash. Explore the [package list](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html) to get a sense of the possibilities.

Alias `open`
------------

Windows does not have the `open` command, and none of the packages above provide it. To alias `open` to Windows' `start` command, navigate to MSYS' `bin/` directory (`C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` or `C:\msys\1.0\bin`) and create an `open.bat` file containing the following:

    @echo off
    start %*

Alias `find`
------------

Windows' own `find` utility shadows the Unix `find` command. To create an alias for the latter, make a copy of `find.exe`, `find2.exe`, in the same folder (typically `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`). The Unix command can now be accessed as `find2`.

Alternatives
------------

Windows 10 includes its own [Linux Bash Shell](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/), based on Ubuntu. Note that this is a *standalone* shell, like PowerShell, so it does not interfere with the command prompt. A standalone shell has the advantage that it may provide functionality that is unavailable in the command prompt, such as persistent command history.

Another comprehensive standalone shell is provided by the [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) project, which can be used on older Windows versions. [MSYS](#msys) and [MinGW](#mingw) also provide standalone shells. "Git Bash", the shell provided by [Git for Windows](#git-for-windows), is an extension of these.
